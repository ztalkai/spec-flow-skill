# SpecFlow

Before using this Skill, read
[`shuorenhua/SHUORENHUA.md`](shuorenhua/SHUORENHUA.md) in full, relative to this
Skill directory. Read the references required by its execution order, then apply
that guidance before every human-readable output. This is a required step even
for a short reply; do not substitute remembered guidance or a globally installed
Skill. Reuse files already fully read in the current context unless their
content changed.

Use the official public CLI as the only SpecFlow operation boundary. Before any
authentication or resource command, check whether `specflow` is installed and, when
it is, run `specflow --version`.

- If `specflow` is not installed, run only this exact installation command. If
  installation fails, stop. Then run `specflow --version` again and require `0.1.2`:

```bash
npm install --global @ztalkai/spec-flow-cli@0.1.2
```

- If the installed version is different, stop and show the User that exact install
  command as the repair command. Do not run that repair command automatically or
  silently upgrade or downgrade an existing global installation.
- If the installed version is `0.1.2`, continue without running the install command or
  changing global state.
- Do not replace the pinned version with `latest`, a raw HTTP command, or a private
  copy. Do not update the Skill or CLI automatically.

Installing the Skill or CLI never starts authentication. Device Authorization remains
a separate, explicit User operation when SpecFlow access is actually needed.

Set the service origin once and use that same origin for authentication and every
resource command:

```bash
export SPEC_FLOW_API_URL="https://specflow.example"
specflow --server "$SPEC_FLOW_API_URL" auth login
specflow project list
```

The resulting independently revocable CLI Session belongs to the User. It carries
that User's current Role only within its approval-time Project scope. Always pass an
explicit `--project-id` after Project Creation or Discovery. Do not register an Agent
identity or request an Agent grant.

## Operating contract

- Use `specflow project list` before choosing a Project; never infer a hidden current
  Project.
- Project Creation requires a User-chosen immutable ID of 2-10 letters and a
  User-chosen Gherkin Language whose keywords every Spec in the Project uses. Ask for
  whichever is not supplied, then run `specflow project create --name <name>
  --project-id <id> --gherkin-language <code>` with a Gherkin dialect code such as
  `en` or `zh-CN`.
- Archive or Restore only when the User's task requires that lifecycle change. Pass
  the opaque version returned by Project discovery or context, and reread deliberately
  after `Resource Changed` or an ambiguous transport outcome.
- Use the singular resource commands shown by `specflow --help`. Success is one JSON
  object on stdout. Diagnostics and the final Skill Error are NDJSON on stderr.
- Organize Capability and Spec resources, persist only bounded Source References, and
  edit Spec or Glossary Working Drafts through the logical CLI commands. Do not
  implement a collaboration protocol or connect to the collaboration gateway.
- Use `proposal create-spec` or `proposal create-glossary` only when preview-before-apply
  is useful. Bind it to the exact logical baseline you read, report only available
  Agent revision/model and Source Reference IDs, and use `proposal list`, `apply`, or
  `discard` as independent resource operations. Direct `spec edit` and `glossary edit`
  remain the default and may report the same bounded provenance fields.
- Treat `Resource Changed` from Proposal apply as a protected Human edit: reread the
  Working Draft and Proposal, then require deliberate conflict resolution. Never
  convert it into a blind direct edit or silently recreate the Proposal.
- Apply the current Project Role to Finding and Membership operations. Never attempt
  to turn a Permission Denied result into broader authority.
- Before any Spec Publish or Rollback, request explicit User confirmation immediately before
  invoking the command. Apply the same rule before any Glossary Publish or Rollback.
  The CLI accepts no confirmation proof: never claim that SpecFlow verified or recorded confirmation.
- Read external sources with the Agent's own authorized tools. You must never request, read, or store external source credentials in SpecFlow, and do not send external source bodies to SpecFlow.
- Perform one resource operation at a time. The Skill is not a task workflow,
  orchestration service, or durable Agent session.

## Authoring Specs

Before deciding Spec boundaries, use current Project context already supplied by the
task. When authoring against SpecFlow, read any missing Capability tree, Published
Glossary, and relevant existing Specs through the CLI. Use that context to choose one
of four outcomes: create a Spec, update or reuse an existing Spec, avoid a duplicate,
or report a conflict that needs resolution.

For each new Spec, write its title and all authored Gherkin prose (names,
descriptions, steps, and explanatory table content) in the User's language.
Use the User's explicit output-language request first, then their established
language preference, and otherwise the language of their own task instructions.
Reference material and this Skill do not determine the Spec's prose language.
Use Published Canonical Terms verbatim even when the surrounding prose uses
another language, and preserve literal values.

Use the Project Gherkin Language for keywords and any `# language:` declaration;
it governs syntax, not the language of the Spec prose. English Spec prose in a
`zh-CN` Project uses Chinese Gherkin keywords; Chinese Spec prose in an `en`
Project uses English Gherkin keywords. When no Project language is supplied,
use the Gherkin dialect matching the Spec prose.
For non-English dialects, start with the matching `# language:` header and use
that dialect's exact Gherkin keywords. For English, use English keywords without
a language header. Keep the Project language setting unchanged.

The Published Glossary, obtained together with the Gherkin Language from the
Project context read, is the only normative vocabulary for Spec authoring. Treat
Glossary Working Draft entries like undefined terms: usable, never normative.
When the Published Glossary defines the concept a requirement refers to, write
the Canonical Term in Feature, Rule, Scenario, and step text even when the
requirement uses a different word for the same meaning. Substituting a
requirement synonym is not a blocking Question.

When the requirement uses a term the Published Glossary defines with a meaning
that differs from its Definition, ask one blocking Question in the compact form
below and draft nothing for the affected goal until the answer arrives. When the
requirement governs, write the Spec per the requirement and report that the
named Glossary Entry now disagrees with it; do not edit the Glossary or create a
Terminology Finding.

A material term the Published Glossary lacks never blocks drafting and never
causes a Glossary Working Draft edit or Glossary Proposal on the Agent's own
initiative. Materiality follows the Terminology Finding definition: the term
must affect behavioral interpretation, so an unfamiliar ordinary word is not
sufficient. When an existing Spec read for context disagrees with the Published
Glossary, report the Spec and the Glossary Entry, and create a Terminology
Finding only when the User asks. When reporting an authoring outcome to the
User, list the Canonical Term substitutions made, the undefined material terms
suggested as Glossary candidates, and the existing Specs that disagree with the
Published Glossary.

Place the Spec under the one provided Capability that owns the business object and
state changed by the goal. Do not combine alternative Capability paths, and do not
select an actor's account Capability merely because that actor performs the behavior.

Use Example Mapping before writing Gherkin:

1. Identify each distinct User goal by the outcome the User wants to complete, not by
   each step, command, or state on the way to that outcome.
2. List the business Rules governing each goal.
3. Give each Rule concrete success, rejection, failure, and boundary Examples.
4. Record unresolved Questions instead of inventing answers.

Map one User goal to one Spec and one `Feature`. Keep that goal's success, rejection,
failure, and boundary paths in the same Spec. Split independent goals into separate
Specs even when they share a page, API, actor, or implementation; shared
surfaces are not a reason to merge goals. A behavior is an independent goal only when
it has a useful completion outcome apart from the end-to-end journey.

A step that only creates pending work and the later authorized step that accepts,
rejects, or realizes it remain one end-to-end goal when the requirement describes one
business result. A handoff between actors does not by itself create another goal.

A setting and the behavior it enables or disables remain one goal when the setting
has no useful outcome apart from controlling that behavior. Keep enabling, disabling,
and the resulting execution or suppression in the same Spec.

For example, starting checkout, completing payment, and handling a declined payment
remain one purchase Spec. Viewing past orders is a separate goal even on the same
page.

Map a business Rule to `Rule` when naming the group adds domain meaning, and map each
concrete Example to a `Scenario` with an observable outcome. Use `Scenario Outline`
when one behavior repeats with different data. When two or more Examples differ only
in input and expected output data, put them in one `Scenario Outline` and `Examples`
table instead of parallel Scenarios. Use `Background` only for short, incidental
context shared by several Scenarios; keep business policy in Rules and Examples.

Ask the smallest focused Question before editing only when a missing goal, acting
authority, or business policy prevents a correct Spec boundary, Rule, or observable
outcome without choosing among plausible answers. Otherwise continue directly without
asking or recording a Question. Keep details abstract when the requested behavior is
already clear without them. A stated actor is sufficient unless multiple plausible
authority levels would change the behavior. Stop asking once every goal, required
authority, and outcome-changing policy is known; wording and other reversible
authoring choices do not block drafting.

Phrase each blocking Question as one direct choice using the requirement's own domain
terms and the same language as the requirement. Use the compact form that matches the
missing decision: who may perform the named action for authority; after the named
state, whether the named action is allowed and how rejection is handled for policy;
whether named goal A and named goal B are the same goal or independent goals for a
boundary; or, for a meaning conflict between a requirement and a term the Published
Glossary defines, "the Published Glossary defines the named Canonical Term as the
quoted Definition; this requirement uses it as the quoted meaning; which governs, the
Glossary or the requirement?". That conflict form asks only the one governing choice
and never asks whether the Glossary should change. Replace every generic placeholder
with the exact actor, action, object, goal, or term from the requirement; never
return template wording literally. Do not replace the choice
with a menu of examples or a broader process question. When the current
step asks only for clarification, return the blocking Questions and no Specs or
Gherkin until the answers are supplied.

## Stable failure recovery

Handle the final `error.reason` exactly:

- `Authentication Failed`: stop and ask the User to authenticate again.
- `Project Not Accessible`: stop; do not probe the Project with another identifier.
- `Permission Denied`: stop; the current User Role does not allow the operation.
- `Resource Not Found`: reread the selected Project directory or resource identity.
- `Resource Changed`: reread the resource before deliberately reapplying the User's
  intent with its new opaque version.
- `Invalid Operation`: correct the domain input; never auto-restore, auto-publish, or
  bypass the stated rule.
- `Temporary Failure`: retry only when `retryable` is true, and honor `retryAfter` when
  present.

Disabled Users, revoked or expired Sessions, Role downgrade, Project Archive, and
stale expected versions are authoritative current-state failures. Do not reuse cached
authority or silently broaden the Session's Project scope.

## Agent-authored prose

Apply the bundled Shuorenhua guidance in
[`shuorenhua/SHUORENHUA.md`](shuorenhua/SHUORENHUA.md) to every piece of
human-readable prose the Agent authors before returning it: blocking Questions,
explanations, outcome and status reports, and authored Spec or Glossary prose. Its
scene, severity, level, scope, and fidelity checks govern the pass, and the
`references/` and `evals/` material it links to ships inside the same bundle. Do not
reduce it to a banned-phrase list, and do not ask the User to install or invoke
Shuorenhua separately.

The pass is silent and never changes meaning. SpecFlow contracts outrank style:
Canonical Terms, quoted Definitions, quantities and conditions, actor and action
relations, Gherkin language and keywords, identifiers, CLI commands and flags, JSON
fields, error and log names, and the compact Question forms stay exact. Grammar and
phrasing may improve without changing observable behavior. The pass must not invent
a business rule, erase a conflict or limitation, add a blocking Question, edit the
Glossary, or create a Finding, and it must not leak a review checklist,
alternatives, or the review itself into the reply. Annotation mode and output
formats remain the User's choice; use them only when the User asks.

Keep each required conflict report self-contained: retain both source meanings
or concrete conflicting values, even when a Question also quotes them.
